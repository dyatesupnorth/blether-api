	noun

## What is it about?

Blether is a project I created to attempt to merge the best bits about social networks into one.
This is the repo for the Blether API, as a forward thinker I envisioned using mobile devices to connect to this as a data service.

## How to run it

This project is quite old, so you might ahve to look at the documentation for the framework it uses.

In theory:
`composer install`

`php artisan migrate`
`php artisan db:seed`
and

`php artisan serve`

should suffice, then the api will be running, ready for a connection.
